The source code for our Jaseci group project is available in this repository. This task entails using Jaseci, a platform for creating and carrying out complicated automation activities, to execute a particular use case.<br>
Two additional walkers that improve the program's functioning have been added as new additions to the Jaseci application.<br>
The initial walker is intended to identify all male family members. For tasks that call for a gender-specific analysis, this functionality will be especially helpful. Users may now run targeted studies and quickly extract all the male family members from their datasets thanks to this new innovation.<br>
The second walker's objective is to identifyÂ family members' blood categories. Users will be able recognize family members with the same blood type and conduct further study according to this functionality.
